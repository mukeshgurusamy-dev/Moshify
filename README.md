## 📌 Notes
```text
The current code is fully responsive and works across all modern 
and older devices.

For very rare cases if there is any layout issue appeared, there are 
some optional styles kept as commented in the code(in styles.css).

You can uncomment those lines and run the project to solve the issue if required.
